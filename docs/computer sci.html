    <h3><marquee>The university was established by the administration of Dr. Bukola Saraki in 2009, and envisioned to be more than a typical university in Nigeria. It was designed to be a center for community service and entrepreneurship. In a country where the fundamental values of volunteerism and community involvement are yet to be fully embraced, The university recognises itself as a part of a community,and has the position of a Director for Community Development for the purpose of mobilizing the community, setting assessment strategies, and identifying the needs within the community so that lecturers can use their expertise to impact directly on the communities.KWASU held her first convocation on 1 June 2013 and inaugurated KWASU Alumni Association.The journey towards establishing a state university in Kwara State began in November 1990.</marquee></h3>

  		<p><b> computer science</b></p>
  		<p>computer science is the study of computer and computational systems.Unlike electrical and computer scientists deal mostly with software and software system;this includes their theory,design,development, and application

		Principle areas of study within computer science includee artifical intelligencee,computer systems and networks,security,database system,human computer interaction,vision,vision and graphics ,numerical analysis,programminng languages,software enginnering,bioinformatics and theory of computing. Althriugh knowing how to program is essemtial to the study of computer science. it ie only the element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms that solve them-to the tangible-designing applications that perform well on handheld devices,that are easy to use,and that uphold security measure.</p>

      The Professional Development Program (PDP) is SFU's highly-regarded teacher education program.
  Established in 1965, the PDP has helped to develop more than 20,000 teachers in British Columbia making it one of the province's oldest and most successful teacher education programs.

  Student teachers who successfully complete the 16-month program are recommended to the Teacher Certification Branch of the BC Ministry of Education for a Teaching Certificate. There is also an option to complete a Bachelor of Education (BEd) as a second degree during the program.
  The PDP has four, full-time semesters that integrate theory and practice to help student teachers explore important education ideas and their application in the classroom. Student teachers work in small cohorts throughout the program and have extended opportunities to interact and build relationships with their peers, teacher educators, and practicing K-12 teachers. Unlike other programs, the PDP also has a unique staffing model that employs highly skilled, seconded teachers as Faculty Associates. These Faculty Associates work closely alongside Faculty Members as the program's teacher educators.</dt>

      <dt>Direct entry is a style of entry into any Nigerian university straight to 200/300level. Typically, when you obtain the unified tertiary matriculation examination form and sit for the examination, you can only gain admission into 100level in any Nigerian university, but if you decide to get the direct entry form and you eventually meet the basic admission requirement, you will gain admission into that university of your choice and you will begin from 200/300level. This strICTly depends on the entry credentials you used to gain admission.

      Who can apply for Direct Entry?

      Not all and sundry can apply for direct entry admission into university. Applying for direct entry is based on your choice of entry into that dream university of yours. Furthermore, direct entry admission into any Nigerian institution of higher education is for applicants who already had a supplementary certificate in combination to their secondary school O’Level. The proposition of this is that, if you are an O’Level holder devoid of any extra certificate, direct entry is not for you.

      Which universities accept Direct Entry application?

      All universities in Nigeria are logically destined to accept direct entry application from Nigerian students and offer them admission into year 2 or 3. Nevertheless, it is possible that some universities might no longer be interested in accepting direct entry students. For now, about 98% of all Nigerian Federal, State and Private Universities still accept direct entry students.

      Am I to tender my academic transcript to my university as a Direct Entry student?

      The reality is that universities in Nigeria have varied principles and requirements when it comes to submission of academic transcripts as a direct entry applicant for your admission processing. Institutions such as University of Ilorin, Usman Danfodio University, Kwara state university, Ahmadu Bello University and many others does not necessitate you to submit transcript as a direct entry applicant. While universities like Obafemi Awolowo University and few others requires it. Consequently, in order for you to be confident of what to do, when the post utme date of your preferred institution is out, the university will emphatically state it that you should present your academic transcripts to a particular address inside the school. In case your school is unspoken about this, then you don’t need to worry or submit any academic transcript.

      Do I need to go to my university of choice to obtain the Direct Entry form?

      You do not need to bother yourself by going to any university before you obtain their direct entry form. Just get it from JAMB office or any of the selected banks that sells it, and then fill it online. Afterward, submit your certificate to Jamb office. Without submitting your direct entry form, Jamb will surely not work on your admission.

      What are the courses offered in Direct Entry admission mode?

      All the courses offered in UTME are also obtainable in direct entry. You can apply for any of the courses in any department/faculty of your choice.
