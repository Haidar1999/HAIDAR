    <h1>Six Reasons to Study Computer Science</h1>
    <p>For those considering a degree in Computer Science, but need further convincing, the Complete University Guide lends its expertise. Here's six compelling reasons to study for Computer Science:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The digital age needs computer scientists;Like it or not, you're living in it – this is the Digital Age. Computer programmes have all but infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Computer scientists theorise, design, develop and apply the software and hardware for the programmes we use day in day out – sounds pretty important to us.</li>
      <li>Computer science students have excellent graduate prospects; Check out our Computer Science subject table, look down the Graduate Prospects column and you'll notice Computer Science students stand a pretty good chance of being professionally employed, or in further study, within six months of leaving uni. And that chance is strengthened if you go to one of the UK's best unis for the subject.</li>
      <li>Computer scientists earn big bucks; Computer scientists are in demand and their salaries reflects this. Recent graduates in professional roles earn quite a lot on average – just take a look what graduates earn.</li>
      <li>Computer scientists are needed in every type of industry; Every industry uses computers so naturally computer scientists can work in any. Problems in science, engineering, health care, and so many other areas can be solved by computers. It's up to the computer scientist to figure out how, and design the software to apply the solution. </li>
      <li>Internationally Diverse Cohort; Computer science departments at typically benefit from having one of the more culturally diverse cohorts at their respective unis. According to HESA data almost 20,000 computer science students come from overseas. A diverse cohort means you'll be exposed to different cultures and potentially finish uni with an international network of contacts to utilise later in life.

      <li>Year abroad opportunities; Computers have gone global, and it would be silly for Computer Science education providers to not reflect this fact. Check the opportunities for overseas study on the courses that interest you. A year abroad will provide you with a deeper understanding of how computers are used around the world, allowing you to experience other cultures, and gain some language skills in the process.</li>
